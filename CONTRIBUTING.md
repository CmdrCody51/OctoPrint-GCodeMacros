Contributions are welcome to all my projects on GitHub, and this is no exception.

## Building the frontend code
This plugin uses webpack & sass to manage compiling the JavaScript & CSS files. This requires a recent version of NodeJS.

* Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
* Run `npm start` to start the development environment, this will watch & build the CSS & JS files in development mode
* Run `npm run release` if you want to test the production-ready, minimized build.

## Creating PRs

Please test your contribution, and explain its purpose clearly when you create commits & a PR.
Make sure you don't include the compiled JS files, though they should be ignored by Git.
